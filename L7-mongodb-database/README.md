# mongodb database
as you saw in the [previous lesson](https://github.com/amiryeg1/nodejs-lessons/tree/master/L6-user-authentication) , we simiulated an authenticating system but we stored the data in arrays.
in this lesson we use mongodb and mongoose to store our data inside database .

## mongodb

MongoDB is an object-oriented, simple, dynamic, and scalable NoSQL database.
It is based on the NoSQL document store model.
The data objects are stored as separate documents inside a collection â€” instead of storing the data into the columns and rows of a traditional relational database.

## mongoose
Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. 
Mongoose supports both promises and callbacks.

Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data.
It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.

## How It Works ?
first we need set a value for our environment variable `mongodb_exercise_jwtPrivateKey` as the token password

open terminal and run the command
```
export mongodb_exercise_jwtPrivateKey=secretKey
```
in the code above i used `secretKey` as my password . (you can set it to anything)

now all we need to do is to start the app
```
npm start
```
open your browser and go to

www.localhost:3000 or www.localhost:3000/home

an html file will open and guide you to work with the app.

**or**

request to www.localhost:3000/signup for registering user

request to www.localhost:3000/login  for logging in

request to www.localhost:3000/names  for seeing the list of users registered
